facing angle = horizontal (hori) or vertical (vert) (normal or shift)

get sensors (back, left)

if we're facing hori / norm
  let back = back
  let side = side
else if we're facing vert / shift
  let side = back
  let back = side

---------- flip check
if side is too far away
  // Note: we "must" be on the other side of the field, so we'll flip
  flip our facing
  nullify this check for 0.5 seconds
else if we're close to the wall
  do nothing really

if side is too close
  move out towards the center

if we have the ball
  do advanced goal shooting

if ball is outside of field
  hang around inside
  (there is no reason to be outside of the field)
